# In this short tutorial, I explain how to use git and github in basic ways.

This tutorial is written for a scientist who is:

(1) new to git and GitHub

(2) wants to use some basic version control and back up all of their code online (on GitHub)

(3) wants students to be able to access that code, download it to their own machine, and also download any updates the instructor adds.
